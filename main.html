                "Associations' music is like a burst of energy. The songs are raucous, rambunctious, reflective, and painfully self-aware.
                As Associations' sole member, Shane Conard pairs confessional lyrics with 
                oft-jolting guitar rifts to create an energetic, yet sobering listening experience!
